<h1 align="center">🤝 Solana Escrow</h1>
<p align="center">A secure, trustless token escrow smart contract on Solana built with Anchor.</p>

## 🔐 About the Project

**Escrow** is a Solana smart contract that enables two users to exchange tokens securely and without trust. This is achieved through an on-chain escrow account that only releases funds when both parties fulfill their obligations.

Built using **Anchor** and tested locally, this project demonstrates how to handle:

- Token transfers
- PDAs and account constraints
- Ownership validation
- Secure program logic on Solana

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔄 Lock tokens in escrow
- 🧾 Support for SPL tokens
- ✅ Accept & complete escrow by second party
- ❌ Cancel by initializer if not fulfilled
- 🔐 Authority and PDA validation
- 🧪 Anchor-based test suite

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- 🦀 Rust + Anchor Framework
- 💰 SPL Token program
- 🔗 Solana Web3.js
- 🧪 Anchor test environment
